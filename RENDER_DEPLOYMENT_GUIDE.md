# Render Deployment Guide

## Environment Variables to Set in Render Dashboard

After connecting your repository to Render, you need to configure these environment variables in the Render dashboard:

### Required Environment Variables:

1. **SENDER_EMAIL**: `donghyeunlee1@gmail.com`
   - This is your Gmail address for sending contact form emails

2. **SENDER_PASSWORD**: `[YOUR_GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD]`
   - You need to generate an App Password from your Gmail account
   - Go to Google Account Settings → Security → 2-Step Verification → App passwords
   - Generate a new app password for "Mail"
   - Use this 16-character password (not your regular Gmail password)

3. **CORS_ORIGINS**: `https://kiryuchi10.github.io`
   - Replace with your actual frontend domain
   - This restricts API access to your frontend only

4. **SECRET_KEY**: (Auto-generated by Render)
   - This is already configured in render.yaml to auto-generate

5. **RECIPIENT_EMAIL**: `donghyeunlee1@gmail.com`
   - Already set in render.yaml

## Deployment Steps:

1. **Create Render Service**:
   - Go to Render dashboard
   - Click "New +" → "Web Service"
   - Connect GitHub and select `kiryuchi10.github.io` repository
   - Render will detect the render.yaml configuration

2. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - In the service settings, add the environment variables listed above
   - Make sure SENDER_PASSWORD uses your Gmail App Password

3. **Deploy**:
   - Click "Create Web Service"
   - Render will automatically build and deploy your backend
   - The build process will run: `cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - The start command will run: `cd backend && python start.py`

4. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Once deployed, you'll get a URL like: `https://portfolio-backend-xxxx.onrender.com`
   - Test the health endpoint: `https://your-backend-url.onrender.com/api/health`

## Testing Endpoints:

After deployment, test these endpoints:

- **Health Check**: `GET /api/health`
- **Analytics**: `GET /api/analytics`
- **Contact Form**: `POST /api/contact`
- **Track Visit**: `POST /api/track-visit`

## Troubleshooting:

- Check Render logs if deployment fails
- Ensure all environment variables are set correctly
- Verify Gmail App Password is working
- Check that the database initializes properly

## Next Steps:

After successful backend deployment:
1. Update frontend API configuration to use the new backend URL
2. Test contact form end-to-end
3. Verify analytics are working with real data
