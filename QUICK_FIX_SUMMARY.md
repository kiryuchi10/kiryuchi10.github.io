# 🚀 Quick Fix Summary - Analytics & Contact Form

## 🎯 Problem Solved
Your portfolio at `https://kiryuchi10-portfolio-3d.netlify.app` was trying to connect to `localhost:5000` which doesn't exist in production, causing:
- ❌ Contact form failures

- ❌ CORS errors

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Netlify Functions Created**
- `netlify/functions/contact.js` - Handles contact form with Gmail integration
- `netlify/functions/analytics.js` - Provides basic analytics data

- `netlify/functions/health.js` - Health check endpoint

### 2. **CORS Issues Fixed**

- Changed from hardcoded domain to origin-based headers
- Added proper preflight handling

### 3. **Configuration Updated**
- `netlify.toml` - Routes API calls to functions
- Environment configuration updated for production
- Added test pages and scripts

```

### Step 3: Set up Gmail App Password
1. Google Account → Security → 2-Step Verification
